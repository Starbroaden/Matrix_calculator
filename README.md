# __Matrix Calculator__
## 1. _What is it?_
This is a simple matrix calculator that can add 2 matrices, subtract one matrix from another, transpose a matrix, and also find the determinant of a square matrix. 
## 2. _How to build and run?_  __(You need to have the gcc compiler installed)__


To assemble the entire project:
> make

To launch the assembled project:
> ./LETSGO

To clean all object files:
> make clean

## 3. _Input and output_
* First, the program will prompt you to enter the number of rows and columns of your matrix, and then enter the elements of the matrix.
* Then, after entering the necessary data, you will be able to choose the desired action on the matrix
    
    > A. Sum a matrix with another
    
    > B. Subtract another one from this matrix
    
    > C. Traspose matrix
    
    > D. Find matrix determinant (__available only for square matrices__)

If you select the first or second item, then you will additionally need to enter the elements of the second matrix, which will have the same number of rows and columns

## 4. _Feedback_
